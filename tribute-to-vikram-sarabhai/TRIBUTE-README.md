>>> ## A Tribute Page to Vikram Sarabhai aka The Father Of Indian Space Program.

# 2️⃣ st Task ✔️ of Level 2️⃣

<br>

> ### I created a project for my internship with Oasis Infobyte that focuses on showcasing the greatness and contributions of Vikram Sarabhai to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The motivation behind this project was to bring awareness to Sarabhai's accomplishments and the role he played in the progress of the organization. Many young people, like myself, are not aware of his contributions and I wanted to change that. I was inspired to create this project after listening to the "Mission ISRO with Harsha Bhogle" podcast on Spotify, which taught me about Sarabhai and the incredible achievements of our space program.
