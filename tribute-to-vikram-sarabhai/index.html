                        several important research and development institutes in India, including the Physical Research
                        Laboratory (PRL), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and the Space Applications
                        Centre
                        (SAC). Sarabhai's work in space research helped to transform India into a major player in the
                        space
                        age. He was deeply interested in the sciences, particularly space science and astronomy,
                        founding
                        several key research and development institutes in India. His work in the development of India's
                        first satellite, Aryabhata, helped establish India's significant presence in the global space
